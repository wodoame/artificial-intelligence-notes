The `iloc()` method in pandas is used for **integer-location based indexing** for selection by position. It allows you to select rows and columns by their integer index positions, which is useful when you want to access specific rows or columns in a DataFrame or Series.

### Key Features of `iloc()`:
1. **Integer-based indexing**: You use integer indices to select rows and columns.
2. **Exclusive of the end index**: Similar to Python slicing, the end index is not included.
3. **Supports slicing, lists, and single integers**: You can pass a single integer, a list of integers, or a slice object.
4. **Works with both DataFrames and Series**.

### Syntax:
```python
dataframe.iloc[row_indexer, column_indexer]
```

- `row_indexer`: The integer index (or slice) for rows.
- `column_indexer`: The integer index (or slice) for columns.

### Examples:

#### 1. Select a Single Row
```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Select the second row (index 1)
row = df.iloc[1]
print(row)
```
Output:
```
A    2
B    5
C    8
Name: 1, dtype: int64
```

---

#### 2. Select Multiple Rows
```python
# Select the first two rows
rows = df.iloc[0:2]
print(rows)
```
Output:
```
   A  B  C
0  1  4  7
1  2  5  8
```

---

#### 3. Select a Single Column
```python
# Select the second column (index 1)
column = df.iloc[:, 1]
print(column)
```
Output:
```
0    4
1    5
2    6
Name: B, dtype: int64
```

---

#### 4. Select Multiple Columns
```python
# Select the first two columns
columns = df.iloc[:, 0:2]
print(columns)
```
Output:
```
   A  B
0  1  4
1  2  5
2  3  6
```

---

#### 5. Select Specific Rows and Columns
```python
# Select the first two rows and the second column
subset = df.iloc[0:2, 1]
print(subset)
```
Output:
```
0    4
1    5
Name: B, dtype: int64
```

---

#### 6. Select Using a List of Indices
```python
# Select the first and third rows
rows = df.iloc[[0, 2]]
print(rows)
```
Output:
```
   A  B  C
0  1  4  7
2  3  6  9
```

---

#### 7. Select Using Negative Indices
```python
# Select the last row
last_row = df.iloc[-1]
print(last_row)
```
Output:
```
A    3
B    6
C    9
Name: 2, dtype: int64
```

### Notes:
- `iloc` is purely integer-based, so it does not consider the labels of rows or columns.
- If you try to access an index that is out of bounds, it will raise an `IndexError`.
- Use `loc` if you want to select rows and columns by labels instead of integer positions.
