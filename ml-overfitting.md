Overfitting in machine learning is like memorizing the answers to a practice test instead of understanding the material. Imagine you have a friend who studies for a math exam by memorizing all the answers to the practice problems. On the practice test, they do great because they know the answers by heart. But on the actual exam, when the questions are slightly different, they struggle because they didn't really learn the underlying concepts.

In machine learning, overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well. It captures all the details and noise in the training data, including the random fluctuations, to the point where it performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. This means the model has essentially "memorized" the training data instead of learning to generalize from it.

To avoid overfitting, we use techniques like:
1. **Cross-validation**: Testing the model on different subsets of the data to ensure it generalizes well.
2. **Regularization**: Adding a penalty for complexity to discourage the model from fitting the noise.
3. **Simplifying the model**: Using fewer features or a less complex model structure.
4. **More data**: Providing more training data to help the model learn better patterns.

The goal is to create a model that performs well not just on the training data, but also on new, unseen data.
