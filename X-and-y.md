In the context of machine learning, particularly in supervised learning, the variables **X** and **y** are commonly used to represent the following:

1. **X**: This typically represents the **input features** (or independent variables) of the dataset. It is a matrix where each row corresponds to a data point (or sample), and each column corresponds to a feature (or attribute) of that data point. For example, if you're working with a dataset of houses, the features might include the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location, etc.

   - Shape: If you have `n` samples and `m` features, `X` will be an `n x m` matrix.

2. **y**: This represents the **target variable** (or dependent variable) that you want your model to predict. It is usually a vector (or a matrix in some cases) where each element corresponds to the target value for a specific data point. For example, in the house dataset, `y` might represent the price of the house.

   - Shape: If you have `n` samples, `y` will be a vector of length `n`.

### Example:
Suppose you have a dataset of houses with the following features:
- Size (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Age of the house

And you want to predict the price of the house.

- **X** (input features) might look like this:
  ```
  [[1500, 3, 10],
   [2000, 4, 5],
   [1200, 2, 20]]
  ```
  Here, each row represents a house, and the columns represent the features (size, bedrooms, age).

- **y** (target variable) might look like this:
  ```
  [300000, 400000, 250000]
  ```
  Here, each value represents the price of the corresponding house.

### In Summary:
- **X** is the input data (features) that the model uses to make predictions.
- **y** is the output data (target) that the model tries to predict.

In supervised learning, the goal is to learn a function \( f \) such that \( f(X) \) approximates \( y \) as closely as possible.
